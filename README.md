## Hi there 👋
**Rudra Sahu**, this side! I’m currently a BS-MS sophomore at [IISER Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/). I enjoy asking questions that sit just beneath the surface, often simple to state, but hard to solve.
My academic interests revolve around fancy physics, such as Astrophysics, Cosmology, Relativistic Physics, and Quantum Mechanics. 

Beyond academics, I have actively contributed to science outreach and event coordination, including [Mimamsa](mimamsa.info) and serving as the current [HELICASE](https://online.fliphtml5.com/thescienceclub_iiserp/rhfr/) coordinator (IISER Pune [Science Club](http://sites.google.com/view/scienceclubiiserp) magazine) and engaging in various student-led initiatives.
